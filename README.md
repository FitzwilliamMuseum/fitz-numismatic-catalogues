The library of auction catalogues and fixed price lists is maintained as a research tool. Its scope is universal, covering all areas and periods, and including sales not only of coins but of other numismatic materials: paper money, tokens, medals, decorations, weights and balances. Some individual non-numismatic (e.g. archaeological) sales are included when the main series is numismatic, but this variation is not consistent.

This online list was updated at the beginning of each month (no idea when this stopped). It shows which catalogues can be consulted in the Department, and also indicates which catalogues we do not now have. We would be very interested in hearing from anyone who has catalogues not on this list, which might be available for sale or exchange â€“ we have duplicate catalogues which we would be prepared to exchange in return.
